#Alsa configuration parameter *in first 6 strings with specified order* of 'alsacf':
#- chunk size in samples * chunks in buffer
#- AudioInputDeviceName
#- AudioOutputDeviceName
#- AudioControlDeviceName
#- capture_mixer_elem
#- playback_mixer_elem

#Alsa buffers size settings can be different for some OS and can cause error
#In this case comment first line by # for test. Default settings will be applied and
#correspondent parameters will be showed. Next play with this parameters.

#Notes: 
#- Buffer MUST containt at least 2 chunks.
#- Chunk size determines internal Jitter compensation. Recomended Jitter compensation value #for Tor TCP connection is 500-1000 mS. 8bit mu-low mono 8000Hz uses. So 1 byte of buffer #size equal to 125 microsecons of audio. Recomended chunk size value is 4800
#- Recomended total buffer size is for at least 3 TCP packets. Each packet contains 10 frames#(codec independenly) and this is 1600 samples (200 mS audio).

#For using pulse audio sets both  AudioInputDeviceName and AudioInputDeviceName as
